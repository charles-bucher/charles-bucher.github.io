 I started teaching myself AWS and Terraform. No bootcamp, no degree—just AWS docs, A.I, YouTube, and a lot of late nights.

I built the projects below to prove I can actually do this work. They're all real, they all run, and I'm paying for them out of my own pocket (though AWS free tier helps a lot).

## What I'm After

I need a Cloud Support Engineer job. Remote preferred, but I'll relocate if the opportunity's right.

I'm targeting [Competitive salary] to start, with room to grow as I gain experience and certifications.

I'm studying for my AWS Solutions Architect Associate cert. Should have it in the next 2-3 months.

---

## Why Hire Me

 “Everything here was built for recruiters tired of buzzwords and hungry for proof.”
---

## Certifications

**In Progress**: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (studying now, planning to test Q1-Q2 2025)

---

## Some Numbers

- Total AWS spend over 9 months: under $50
- Current monthly infrastructure cost: about $2
- GitHub commits in 2024: 200+
- Lines of Terraform code written: 2,000+
- Terraform modules created: 8+
- Projects deployed to production: 4
- Late nights learning after kids go to bed: too many to count

---

## If You're a Recruiter

Start with the monitoring project—it's the most relevant to Cloud Support Engineer work.

Check out the live portfolio site to see I can actually deploy infrastructure.

Read this README to understand who I am and why I'm doing this.

If any of this resonates, let's talk. I'm ready to interview and can start immediately.

---

## If You're a Hiring Manager

Everything here is real and deployable. Clone any repo and run `terraform plan` if you want to see the code.

I document everything because that's how I'd work on your team. Check my commit history to see how I learn and iterate.

I'm not the candidate with the pedigree. I'm the candidate who will show up every day, figure things out, and get better consistently.

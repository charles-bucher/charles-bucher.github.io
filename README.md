# Tommy813 Cloud Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my live cloud lab — a collection of hands-on builds aligned with AWS cert domains and SRE principles. Every project here is deployable, cert-mapped, and built from scratch to showcase real infrastructure skills.

## 🔧 Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [ec2-webapp-with-s3-backend](projects/ec2-webapp-with-s3-backend/README.md) | Hybrid web app with EC2 frontend and S3 backend, IAM-secured |
| [s3-cloudfront-secure-static-site](projects/s3-cloudfront-secure-static-site/README.md) | Static site hosted via S3 + CloudFront with OAI and HTTPS |
| [Proactive-monitoring-with-cloudwatch-sns](projects/Proactive-monitoring-with-cloudwatch-sns/README.md) | CloudWatch alarms triggering SNS alerts for proactive ops |
| [multi-tier-network-sim](projects/multi-tier-network-sim/README.md) | Simulated multi-tier VPC with public/private layers and routing |

## 📜 AWS Cert Mapping

Each project maps directly to AWS cert domains:
- **Solutions Architect**: VPC design, EC2 provisioning, IAM roles
- **SysOps Admin**: Monitoring, alerting, automation
- **Developer Associate**: Serverless, S3 hosting, event-driven flows

See [docs/cert-mapping.md](docs/cert-mapping.md) for detailed alignment.

## 🛠 Tools Used

Terraform, PowerShell, GitHub Actions, AWS CLI, CloudWatch, Lambda, SNS, S3, EC2, IAM, CloudFront

## 🧠 About Me

I iterate fast, troubleshoot in real time, and build with recruiter optics in mind. Every folder here is modular, cert-aligned, and built to ship.

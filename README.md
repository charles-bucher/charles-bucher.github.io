🧠 TL;DR — Cloud Engineer Portfolio (GitHub Pages)
This repository powers my live portfolio: charles-bucher.github.io
It showcases AWS-aligned cloud infrastructure projects, built entirely from scratch, with a focus on automation, scalability, and real-world deployment.

✅ Hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom HTML layout
📸 Includes live screenshots of deployed infrastructure
🔗 Linked AWS Projects: GuardDuty, CloudFront, CloudWatch, VPC simulation
🧱 Mapped to AWS Certified Solutions Architect & Cloud Practitioner domains
🎯 Designed for clarity, certification alignment, and technical verification

🏗️ Portfolio Overview
Built, secured, and deployed production-ready cloud infrastructure using AWS and Terraform.
Every project demonstrates hands-on experience, not theory — IaC, monitoring, security, and cost optimization, all proven in live environments.

Highlights
4 AWS projects deployed: S3, CloudFront, CloudWatch, and VPC

2,000+ lines of Terraform written and modularized

CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions + Terraform workflows

Live infrastructure cost: under $2/month

Deployed with CloudFront CDN for global performance

🎯 Current Focus
Seeking: Cloud Engineer | Junior DevOps | Infrastructure Engineer
Availability: Immediate | Remote preferred
Certifications: Studying for AWS Solutions Architect – Associate (target Q1–Q2 2025)

⚙️ Skills
AWS: EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, SNS, CloudFront, ACM, Route 53, GuardDuty, NAT Gateways
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform (modules, state mgmt, multi-env setups)
Monitoring: CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, SNS alerting, log analysis
Networking: Subnet design, routing tables, security group isolation
Security: IAM least-privilege, HTTPS/TLS enforcement, bucket & OAC policies
Automation & Tools: Bash scripting, AWS CLI, GitHub Actions, Git
Learning: Python (boto3), Lambda, RDS management

🧩 Design Philosophy
Proof Over Theory: Everything here runs on AWS — no simulations.

Security First: Encryption, IAM hardening, and continuous auditing.

Scalable by Design: IaC-driven provisioning for fast rebuilds.

Cost Efficient: All live projects maintained under $2/month.

🧭 Why This Portfolio Exists
I taught myself AWS and Terraform through docs, A.I., and late-night hands-on work.
No bootcamp, no degree — just practice, iteration, and proof.
Every repo here exists to demonstrate capability, not just talk about it.

If you’re a recruiter or hiring manager:

Check the CloudWatch project — closest to Cloud Support work.

Clone any repo, run terraform plan, and see it’s real.

Review my commits — you’ll see consistent iteration and documentation.

I may not have a pedigree, but I deliver working systems and keep improving daily.

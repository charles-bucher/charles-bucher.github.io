🧑‍💻 Charles Bucher — Cloud Support Engineer in Progress
Self-taught  Security Labs  Incident Response Workflows  Modular GitHub Portfolio

🚧 What This Site Represents
This isn’t a polished product showcase. It’s a living portfolio built from late-night labs, real AWS documentation, and trial-by-error learning. Every repo simulates a support scenario I’ve had to figure out from scratch — just like I would in a cloud support role.

🛠️ Support-Focused Labs
Each project tackles a real-world problem a customer might face. I document the setup, the troubleshooting, and the lessons learned — including what didn’t work.

🧠 What I Practice in Every Lab
- Reproducing customer issues
- Documenting root cause analysis
- Building alerting and remediation workflows
- Explaining AWS services in plain language
- Cost awareness and support empathy
- Honest assessment of what I know vs. what I’m learning

📸 Screenshot-Driven Proof
Every repo includes screenshots of each phase — from console clicks to Terraform apply. I treat every lab like a support ticket: reproducible, explainable, and transparent.

🧭 My Learning Path
- AWS Cloud Practitioner ✅
- AWS Solutions Architect (Studying)
- AWS Security Specialty (Next)
- Nightly labs in Terraform, IAM, CloudWatch, Lambda
- Building modular GitHub assets for recruiter conversion
